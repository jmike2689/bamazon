This is an application that will simulate an Amazon database being updated as purchases are made.

## Getting Started

To get the application to work, pull up your terminal/command prompt and change directory to where the bamazon.js file is located. Once in that directory, you are able to start the application by typing "node bamazon.js".

### Application in use

Once the application has been initiated, you will get a connection successful prompt followed by the items for sale. At the bottom of the list will be a prompt asking what you'd like to purchase.

You will then be asked which item from the inventory list you'd like to purchase and how many of the item. Once you complete those prompts, the inventory list will show again with updated stock quantities. For this example, we used item #8, Brine Sunglasses.

If a user enters an item that is not on the list, they will receive an error and ask to enter in their product again.

### Closing Application

And lastly, if the user would want to quit the application, they would simply type "Q" in the prompt and that will end the connection.
